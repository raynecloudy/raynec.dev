      <p>rayne is my persona. she's 15 and uses she/her, he/him, and they/them pronouns. she's also transgender. while she is not radically feminine, she is still leaning feminine.</p>
      <h2>lore</h2>
      <p>rayne is the encompassing entity of <a href="/c/hayden">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley">hayley</a>. she depicts traits of both of them, both psychologically (f.e. hayden's ability to chill, but also hayley's whimsy) and physically (f.e. hayden's hairstyle, hayley's hairpin).</p>
      <p>note that rayne does NOT have multiple personality disorder—she is the result of hayden and hayley being merged into one person and sense of self.</p>
      <h2>appearance</h2>
      <h3>physical</h3>
      <p>because hayley was a supernatural entity, rayne also possesses supernatural abilities. she can levitate a foot off the ground, and she emits a faint pink glow.</p>
      <p>she's biologically male—she does not have breasts. she never did. TwT</p>
      <p>she has soft shoulders.</p>
      <p>she's 5' 7".</p>
      <p>her hair is naturally a light coffee brown color. she doesn't have hair anywhere but on the top of her head!</p>
      <p>her eyes are light pink.</p>
      <p>she is white.</p>
      <h3>cosmetic</h3>
      <p>rayne's hair is dyed a light pink.</p>
      <p>don't worry too much about a set wardrobe for rayne. however, if you want to draw her using the canon wardrobe, here it is (from top to bottom):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>two star accessories in hair, one much bigger than the other. the bigger one is a gradient from lavender to light pink, and the smaller one is light pink.</li>
        <li>pink spherical earrings</li>
        <li>lime green sports bra</li>
        <li>oversized beige tee with a star design</li>
        <li>two bracelets: one purple, one rainbow</li>
        <li>red plaid skirt</li>
        <li>pink thigh-high socks</li>
        <li>grey sandals</li>
      </ol>
