    <p>rayne is my persona. she's 15 and uses she/her, he/him, and they/them pronouns. she's also transgender.</p>
    <h2>lore</h2>
    <p>rayne is the encompassing entity of <a href="/c/hayden.html">hayden</a> and <a href="/c/hayley.html">hayley</a>. she depicts traits of both of them, both psychologically (f.e. hayden's ability to chill, but also hayley's <span title="i love this word">whimsy</span>) and physically (f.e. hayden's hairstyle, hayley's hairpin).</p>

<p>note that she does NOT have multiple personality disorder—she is the result of hayden and hayley being merged into one person and sense of self.</p>
